# Musicode

The experience intended for this Swift Playground is to combine coding and music, enabling the user to "code" their songs using the samples and instruments available. It also provides a visualization with very cute animated pixel art animals! To make this experience possible, the playground uses SwiftUI and AVFoundation, which thankfully are simple and straightforward to use. After the playground is opened, the user may open the main Swift file of the application, being greeted by cheerful comments explaining what is editable and what is possible to do within the intended editable arrangement functions. Those main three functions are the keyboard, drum and tambourine arrangements, which are all executed at the same time, making sequential calls to functions that animate and play each respective instrument.

This is my project for WWDC21 Scholarship.
